# GraphRAG
Key Concepts1. Vector Database-Based RAGCore Idea: Uses vector embeddings (e.g., from models like BERT, Sentence-BERT, or OpenAI embeddings) to represent text chunks. Queries are matched to relevant chunks via similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity) in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS).
Strengths:Fast and scalable for large datasets.
Effective for semantic similarity search.
Simple to implement with pre-trained embedding models.

Weaknesses:Lacks explicit representation of relationships between entities or concepts.
May struggle with complex queries requiring contextual or relational understanding.
Retrieval can be "flat," missing hierarchical or networked connections.

2. Graph-Based RAGCore Idea: Represents knowledge as a graph (nodes = entities/concepts, edges = relationships) using a knowledge graph (e.g., Neo4j, RDF, or custom graph structures). Retrieval leverages graph traversal or queries (e.g., Cypher) to fetch relevant nodes/edges, which are then used to augment generation.
Strengths:Captures explicit relationships (e.g., "Person A works at Company B") for better contextual retrieval.
Excels in queries requiring multi-hop reasoning (e.g., "Who are the colleagues of Person A at Company B?").
Can incorporate structured data and ontologies.

Weaknesses:More complex to set up and maintain (requires graph construction).
May be slower for large-scale similarity searches compared to vector DBs.
Less effective for unstructured, free-form text without clear relationships.
